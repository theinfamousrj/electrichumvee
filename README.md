# ElectricHumvee

In the interest of transparency, I'm logging everything here.

## Why am I doing this?

- I want to build my own electric vehicle
- I want that vehicle to be ridiculous
- I want to record the entire thing
- I want to try to offset the cost

## Assumptions

- Nobody else has done this with a full build log
- Other people are as ridiculous as I am
- I can build some kind of audience

## Tech Stack

- React running on GKE
- GCP Cloud Functions
- GCP Cloud SQL
